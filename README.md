Django template that created by Heroku is used.

The purpose of this project is to implement flight reservation bot. Assignments of the bot are to make connection between the Facebook
Messenger and Skyscanner by using their APIâ€™s. Facebook users can make queries on Facebook Messenger and take the price information about
flights from the Skyscanner API. For example, user enter the source place, destination place and date of the flight and user get the 
cheapest price of that flight. Flight queries can be for one direction flights and two direction (there and back) flights.  Also, bot is
responsible to answer the basic requests which come from Facebook users. In this project, our bot is named as Skybot.
